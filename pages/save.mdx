    # App **Save**

    Anyone with a phone can expose global injustice. Anyone with Save can preserve truth to power.

    ## More

    Save is an easy-to-use mobile app designed to help you store, share, and amplify your mobile media while protecting your identity. It's also free, open-source, and available for iOS. Watch out for our new Android app, coming soon!

    Our smartphone media plays a critical role in exposing global injustice every day â€” however eyewitnesses and human rights defenders need better tools  to ensure the evidence they've captured is shared and stored securely. Enter Save. Designed with extensive community input, the app shifts power into the hands of those on the frontlines by streamlining media workflows to facilitate rapid response and reporting. With Save, you can now safely share, archive, verify, and encrypt your media without fear of censorship, surveillance, or retribution.

    ## **Core** features

    Unlike other media-sharing tools, Save offers a suite of responsive features that streamline secure preservation based on community input and our commitment to digital inclusion.

        Save always uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to ensure in-transit security and encryption. When you enable Tor for mobile (either via Orbot: Tor for Android or Onion Browser for iOS), you add an additional layer of protection to ensure no one intercepts your media as it travels from your phone to the Internet Archive or your server of choice.

    # Our App, ***Save***

    Anyone with a phone can expose global injustice. Anyone with Save can preserve truth to power.

    ## About ***Save***

Enter ***Save***. Designed with extensive community input, the app shifts power into the hands of those on the frontlines by streamlining media workflows to facilitate rapid response and reporting. With ***Save***, you can now safely share, archive, verify, and encrypt your media without fear of censorship, surveillance, or retribution.

    ## **Core** features

    Unlike other media-sharing tools, ***Save*** offers a suite of responsive features that streamline secure preservation based on community input and our commitment to digital inclusion.

    <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](core-authenticate.svg)

        ##### Authenticate media

        With ***Save***, you ensure your media is always authenticated because you have full control—without interference from intermediaries—from phone to archive. And, when paired with ProofMode (available now [for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.witness.proofmode&hl=en&gl=US), iOS coming soon), you can even add sensor data to corroborate the metadata captured alongside your media.
    </CoreFeatureItem>
    <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](core-transit.svg)

        ##### Secure transit

        ***Save*** always uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to ensure in-transit security and encryption. When you enable Tor for mobile (either via [Orbot: Tor for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android&hl=en&gl=US) or [Onion Browser for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448)), you add an additional layer of protection to ensure no one intercepts your media as it travels from your phone to the Internet Archive or your server of choice.
        </CoreFeatureItem>
     <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](core-preservation.svg)

        ##### Long-term Preservation

        When you use ***Save*** to archive your mobile media in a trusted archive (such as the Internet Archive or OwnCloud), you ensure unobstructed access for generations to come. This is in stark contrast to popular social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, which aren’t committed to long-term media preservation.

     <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](core-licensing.svg)

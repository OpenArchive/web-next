    ## **Features**

    Unlike other media-sharing tools, ***Save*** offers a suite of responsive features that streamline secure preservation based on community input and our commitment to digital inclusion.

    <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](core-authenticate.svg)

        ##### Authenticate media

        With ***Save***, you ensure your media is always authenticated because you have full control—without interference from intermediaries—from phone to archive. And, when paired with [ProofMode](https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.witness.proofmode/) (available now [for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.witness.proofmode&hl=en&gl=US), iOS coming soon), you can even add sensor data to corroborate the metadata captured alongside your media.
    </CoreFeatureItem>
    <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](core-transit.svg)

        ##### Secure transit

        ***Save*** always uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to ensure in-transit security and encryption. When you enable [Tor](https://torproject.org) for mobile (either via [Orbot: Tor for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android&hl=en&gl=US) or [Onion Browser for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448)), you add an additional layer of protection to ensure no one intercepts your media as it travels from your phone to the Internet Archive or your server of choice.
        </CoreFeatureItem>
     <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](core-preservation.svg)

        ##### Long-term Preservation

        When you use ***Save*** to archive your mobile media in a trusted archive (such as the Internet Archive or OwnCloud), you ensure unobstructed access for generations to come. This is in stark contrast to popular social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, which aren’t committed to long-term media preservation.
    </CoreFeatureItem>
     <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](core-licensing.svg)

        ##### Licensing

        With ***Save*** you can communicate your intentions for future use by easily generating a Creative Commons license in-app allowing others to reuse or modify your work.
    </CoreFeatureItem>
     <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](core-organized.svg)

        ![](additional-flag.svg)

    </CoreFeatureItem>
     <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](additional-import.svg)

        ##### Import Media

    </CoreFeatureItem>
     <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](additional-redundency.svg)

        ##### Improve Redundancy

        With ***Save*** you can further protect your media by creating and storing multiple copies on different secure servers. Whether hosting locally or remotely, your data can be encrypted on the backend and only accessible by who you want.
    </CoreFeatureItem>
    <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](additional-progress.svg)

        ##### View Progress

        When storing media via ***Save***, you can view how much content has been uploaded.
    </CoreFeatureItem>
    <CoreFeatureItem>
        ![](additional-prioritize.svg)

        ##### Prioritize Uploads

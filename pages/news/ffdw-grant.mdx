OpenArchive is thrilled to announce our collaboration with Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) to advance our mission to empower people to ethically collect, verify, and securely preserve their mobile media for the long term.

Through this collaboration, we are receiving a grant from FFDW to expand our **global partnerships with human rights defenders** and join the growing movement to create and utilize a **more ethical, decentralized internet.**

OpenArchive will now be able to support those who collect evidentiary media by expanding the capacity of our [**_Save_**](/save) (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app to include decentralized backends. This will enable people on the ground capturing images and footage of crucial world events to leverage IPFS, Filecoin, and other decentralized storage options from their phones.

Citizens armed with phones are history’s first responders, accelerating the push for worldwide social justice, using their smartphones as a tool to capture human rights violations around the world. However, many of these recordings are currently stored on vulnerable platforms that do not provide sufficient privacy protections or preservation of this vital media. When data is in the hands of a single company, it is susceptible to censorship, manipulation, or system-wide failure – putting the records of human history at risk. Decentralized technology offers a better alternative: it allows at-risk communities to own and control records to ensure transparency, accountability, and durability.

> Every day, witnesses and citizen reporters bravely capture breaking world events–and all too often human rights violations–on their phones. At OpenArchive, we work to enable them to securely share, verify, and preserve this crucial media to ultimately bring accountability and justice.

> We’re thrilled to work with FFDW to build the web we want by implementing and deploying decentralized technology to empower witnesses to protect and preserve truth to power.

Save is a secure archiving app that helps people share, archive, verify, and and encrypt their mobile media. They can do so by securely uploading it, keeping it safe and organized for the long-term, and capturing crucial metadata to further authenticate it. With support from FFDW, we are enhancing our existing archival tools to support decentralized storage solutions through Save. This work will ensure that everyone will have long-term access to secure and resilient decentralized storage to protect and preserve humanity’s most important information.

Additionally, as part of the grant, we will embark on a campaign to educate people and organizations around the world about the benefits of adopting decentralized storage protocols by equipping them with tools and educational resources. Our work will also focus on empowering at-risk communities to move away from the single-point-of-failure infrastructure that they rely on today.

> Our mission is to permanently preserve humanity’s most important information. We are proud to support OpenArchive’s work to preserve critical human rights data using the decentralized web.

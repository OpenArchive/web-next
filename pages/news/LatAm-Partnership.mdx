OpenArchive is partnering with two Latin American organizations, the Latin American Association for Alternative Development ([ALDEA](http://www.fundacionaldea.org/)) in Ecuador and [Cubalex](https://cubalex.org/), a Cuban NGO, to bolster community archiving efforts and workflows beyond our current projects in MENA and Ukraine.

“After working primarily in North America, MENA, and Eastern Europe over the last decade, we are eager to finally address the needs for a secure way to verify and preserve evidentiary media that have been building in Latin America. Cubalex and ALDEA are doing important work to protect and defend human rights and we look forward to partnering with them to help them fulfill their critical missions,” said Natalie Cadranel, Founder and Executive Director of OpenArchive.

“It is essential that those on the frontlines documenting evidence of abuse of power, social injustice, and human rights violations have access to the necessary tools and support to carry out their work more effectively and safely. OpenArchive’s partnerships with Cubalex and ALDEA are an excellent step towards holding those in power accountable, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean, where authoritarianism is on the rise,” said David Aragort, OpenArchive’s Latin America DAC Manager.

ALDEA Foundation is an Ecuadorian organization that aims to collectively design strategies with people, communities, and territories to advance development in human rights, gender equity, and interculturality. Since 2020, ALDEA has invested in building its organizational digital infrastructure to create more sustainable mechanisms for preserving documentation and multimedia content. OpenArchive’s partnerships with ALDEA will advance this project by helping integrate reliable workflow tools, develop compatible storage systems, and strengthen information management strategies. 

Cubalex is a Cuban NGO that defends and promotes human rights as a form of social transformation through legal aid and other resources. In recent years, the Cuban government has [responded](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2022/country-chapters/cuba) to dissent and public criticism with brutal repression and violence. Cubalex is one of the primary organizations documenting abuse against protesters and other human rights defenders. One of Cubalex’s top priorities is documentation and a significant volume of the organization’s resources are channeled towards safely maintaining evidence. OpenArchive’s partnership with Cubalex aims to expand the organization’s capacity to document and store evidence safely and securely.  

“The documentation and archiving of human rights violations have allowed Cubalex to raise awareness, sensitize the public, and reconstruct the historical memory in Cuba. The security and protection of information are part of the guarantees that victims need to exercise and enjoy their right to truth, justice, and reparation. We appreciate OpenArchive's opportunity to improve our archiving system and its contribution to ensuring that the horrors of the past and present in Cuba are not repeated in the future,” said Laritza Diversent, Executive Director of Cubalex.

In the coming months, OpenArchive will be launching needs assessments with both the Ecuadorian and Cuban communities. The findings of these surveys will serve as the foundation for future co-research, trainings, joint capacity building projects, and support within each region. 

OpenArchive uses a [human rights centered co-research and design approach](https://www.humanrightscentered.design/) to work with communities worldwide to develop safer and usable mobile archiving tools and workflows. OpenArchive mobilized this [recent research](https://open-archive.org/news/memo-from-kharkiv) alongside its partners – including KHPG in [Ukraine](https://open-archive.org/news/memo-from-kharkiv), INSM in [Iraq](https://open-archive.org/news/memo-from-baghdad), and an organization in Sudan – which offers a critical foundation on which to further develop this research across regional contexts. 

Beyond these programs in Latin America, OpenArchive is partnering with Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs) worldwide to preserve evidence of war crimes, injustice, and human rights abuses. OpenArchive has active partnerships with DACs in [Ukraine](https://open-archive.org/news/KHPG-partnership), Sudan, [Iraq](https://open-archive.org/news/IraqiNetwork-partnership), and the United States.

OpenArchive supports its DACs with funding, trainings, and ethnographic research to learn about their needs and pain points, by sharing technical expertise about best practices for creating and maintaining a secure archive, and training them on how to use [**_Save_**](https://open-archive.org/save) to protect and simplify their archival workflows. OpenArchive developed its [**_Save_**](https://open-archive.org/save) (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app in 2015 to circumvent these obstacles. [**_Save_**](https://open-archive.org/save) helps eyewitnesses preserve, protect, authenticate, and amplify crucial records of human rights abuses.

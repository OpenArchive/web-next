OpenArchive, an organization dedicated to advancing freedom of digital expression, announced today the release of a new mobile application, [Save](/save), that safeguards digital evidence of human rights abuses around the world.

As police violently crack down on peaceful protests, social media companies censor evidence of war crimes, national telecom services are suspended in times of unrest, and governments seek to suppress documentary evidence of atrocities, witnesses capturing media on mobile phones play a key role in exposing injustice during turbulent times around the world. Save makes it easy for journalists, activists, lawyers and others to safely store, share, preserve and amplify documentation of human rights injustices without fear of censorship, surveillance or retribution.

Our Save app, which is open source and available for free through the iOS App Store and Google Play, fills the urgent need for an alternative to mainstream technologies, one that enables free and reliable sharing of evidence of human rights abuses and breaking news in ways that are easily accessed and managed.

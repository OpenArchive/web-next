## Assessing the Documentation Needs of Human Rights Defenders
### Looking Back on OpenArchive’s DAC Cohort One
By Natalie Cadranel, Lauren Salim, and Claire August

</ArticleHeaderSection>
<ContentSection>

At OpenArchive, we work to create a more just, equitable, and sustainable media ecosystem where people's history is the primary history. 

We do this by 
1. partnering with Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs) to jointly support decentralization, archiving, and preservation efforts to ensure human rights documentation is safe and accessible in the long term; 

2. building responsive tools like our **_Save_** app which helps eyewitnesses preserve, protect, authenticate and amplify crucial records of human rights abuses; 

3. developing best practice guides on preserving evidence and combatting disinformation; and 4) conducting co-research with at-risk communities around the world. 

Our [DAC Program](https://open-archive.org/programs) is one of the key ways we interact with communities that are documenting and preserving evidentiary media. Working with a community manager with deep regional knowledge, we provide needs assessments, security and archival workshops, assistance with internal documentation and workflows, *****_Save_***** implementation and integration with organizations’ backend archives, and funding to support their activities and archives.

Through the collaboration, we gain valuable insights into the needs, frustrations, workflows, limitations, and threats our user communities face. This research allows us to adapt and update the *****_Save_***** app and customize workshops, trainings, and guides. We publish our research findings to share with the broader community of archival and human rights practitioners and scholars.

Most importantly, the communities we work with can grow or strengthen their archiving and documentation processes.


##### A Look at Cohort 1


OpenArchive is fortunate to collaborate with inspiring Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs) who are actively defending human rights worldwide. In 2023, we had seven DACs from [Eastern Europe](https://open-archive.org/programs/our-users/eastern-europe), [MENA](https://open-archive.org/programs/our-users/mena), the [United States of America](https://open-archive.org/programs/our-users/north-america), and [Latin America](https://open-archive.org/programs/our-users/latam) who work to document violations 

and safeguard evidence despite escalating challenges and human rights abuses.

###### Program Structure

The DAC program framework is customized to match DAC partners’ most pressing needs and meet communities where they are at with their comfortability with technology and their specific threat landscape. 

The program generally follows three phases of work. 

![](DACCohortOne_1.png)

###### Phase 1: Co-Research

During phase one, OpenArchive meets with the DAC manager and other key members of the DAC organization to get a preliminary understanding of who they are, who they work with, and their current workflow for managing and preserving evidentiary media. 
OpenArchive works with the DAC to co-develop a needs assessment survey to capture community members' strengths, goals, tasks, tools, technical skill levels and the environment and threat landscape in which they operate. This information will allow us to customize the support and training plans we provide for the subsequent phases of the partnership. 
Then, the DAC manager works to distribute the needs assessment survey with their network in their country/region.

###### Phase 2: Research Analysis and Publication

In phase two, the DAC partner and OpenArchive review and analyze survey responses.

Further needs assessment research is sometimes required, including follow-up surveys and further interviews. 

During the research analysis phase, we carefully assess survey respondents’ threats, needs, technical capacities, and current archival workflows through user persona building and other research methods outlined in the [human-rights-centered-design (HRCD) methodology](https://www.humanrightscentered.design/). This allows us to gain deeper insight into the structural harms that the DAC and its partner organizations experience and enables us to adapt our tools to better protect them and their media.
User personas are modeled after a particular individual or role but also incorporate fictional aspects that researchers use to create archetypes that describe the behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, background information, and the environment in which the role operates. This HRCD strategy is an intersectional, thorough, and secure approach to developing a robust archetype representing key characteristics relevant to the role.

After research collection is concluded, and the findings have been analyzed, [a research memo and personas](https://open-archive.org/programs) are published on OpenArchive’s [website](https://open-archive.org/). We also meet with the DAC to review key recommendations, discuss the next phase, including training plans, and see where else we can support them in their work. 

###### Phase 3: Holding Community Workshops & Sharing Feedback

Key personnel from DAC attend a train-the-trainer session led by OpenArchive. These train-the-trainer sessions are an opportunity for us to go through their primary risks, what **_Save_** does and doesn’t do, and how the **_Save_** app can benefit their community with a small group.
Over two hours, we talk them through a live demo of the app and include plenty of time for questions and answers and any technical troubleshooting they need. After the session, it is our goal that attendees feel equipped to hold workshops on the app independently with their larger community. 
DAC partners also assist with translations of guides or other materials if needed, and host larger community workshops on how to use **_Save_**. Importantly, they also collect feedback on usability and features from the community, so OpenArchive can continue to improve the app. 
The partnership continues even after the community workshops are completed. OpenArchive remains available to answer any questions and provide support when needed. 

##### What our DAC partners had to say

##### What our DAC partners had to say

We have grouped the key challenges and threats that the communities face into four buckets: physical security, digital security, access to information, and technical/resource restraints. 

Some areas, like Ukraine, were primarily concerned with technical and resource restraints. In contrast, other places like Cuba and Ecuador were more focused on the physical dangers they experienced in the course of their work.

</script>

Commonly identified threats: device confiscation/loss of media; privacy and digital security; physical security for themselves, work contacts or loved ones, imprisonment, and accessing public information. 

Our top recommendations: integrating workflow tools like **_Save_** to help manage and preserve their evidence, using VPNs and encrypted messaging apps, investing in resources that boost internet connectivity, and technical training that focuses on digital security.

##### What’s Next for OpenArchive and the DAC Program

Through several phases of co-research, OpenArchive learned more about the unique contexts our DACs work in and gained a better understanding of their needs. 

Using findings from our co-research, we will continue to customize workshops and trainings and implement usability enhancements to our [**_Save_** app]. Over the next couple of years, we will also be adding several security features, including end-to-end encryption, to **_Save_** to better protect our users and their media as they work to document, preserve, and share evidence of human rights abuses. 

Contact us at info@open-archive.org to learn more about **_Save_** training opportunities. 

In the next few months, we will be publishing a research paper on the benefits and drawbacks of using decentralized web storage in repressive regions. This paper builds on our previous two blog posts on [Mapping the Decentralized Web Ecosystem](https://open-archive.org/news/mapping-the-decentralized-storage-ecosystem) and [Harm Reduction for History’s First Responders](https://open-archive.org/news/harm-reduction-for-historys-first-responders)xn.

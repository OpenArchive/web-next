OpenArchive has an active partnership with the People’s Media Record – an archive and repository for community-produced media from Philadelphia. The two organizations joined forces in 2022 to strengthen PMR’s archival tools, workflows, and trainings. Together they are designing and implementing a workshop series for the local community.

OpenArchive previously partnered with an anonymous human rights organization to conduct co-research to threat-model and create personas in order to map out the use cases and ecosystem.Through this co-research, we were able to identify key pain points and threats these communities face and incorporate this research into building responsive, usable tools to help mitigate harm and technological challenges.

Below you’ll find use cases, press releases, and updates from our co-research with our North American community partners.

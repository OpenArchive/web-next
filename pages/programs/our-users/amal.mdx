### Pain points

- For OSINT-related work, content is often deleted before it can be verified and preserved.
- Gaps in mobile data coverage and high risks associated with WiFi networks outside of familiar/secure networks in the office make connecting to the internet very challenging.
- Limited data plans make it difficult to upload, download, and share multimedia files while on the road.

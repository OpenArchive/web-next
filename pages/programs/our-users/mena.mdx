OpenArchive has two active partnerships in the MENA region.

In 2023, OpenArchive partnered with the Iraqi Network for Social Media (INSM-Iraq), the first network of digital rights defenders and experts in Iraq, to bolster their archiving efforts and workflows. Established in 2011, INSM-Iraq is a nonprofit, nongovernmental civil society organization that advocates for a free, open, diverse, and safe internet.

OpenArchive and a Sudanese NGO – who wishes to remain anonymous due to security concerns – joined forces in Spring 2023 to strengthen the resources and support for those documenting and archiving injustices at a time of burgeoning crisis and conflict.

Below you’ll find use cases, press releases, and updates from our co-research with our Iraqi and Sudanese community partners.

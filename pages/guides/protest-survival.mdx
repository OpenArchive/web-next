## OpenArchive’s U.S. Protest Survival Guide

Harm reduction for documenting protests

</ArticleHeaderSection>

<ContentSection>

Planning on documenting a protest or action in your community?

We created OpenArchive’s [U.S. Protest Survival Guide](https://www.open-archive.org/pdf/protest-survival-guide.pdf) with and for citizen reporters, community organizers, and legal observers dedicated to tracking evidence of police violence, far-right extremism, and human rights abuses. 

In it, we share best practices and harm reduction measures for documenting crucial evidence while also protecting at-risk groups from danger and retraumatization.

Use this guide and our secure mobile archiving app [***Save***](https://open-archive.org/save) to keep yourselves and your media safe!

### Learn:

- How to combat surveillance;
- What to bring to a protest (and what not to bring);
- What you should be documenting;
- What to do if you’re arrested (or if you see someone else get arrested);
- What you should consider before sharing evidentiary media.

Learn how to ethically and safely store sensitive mobile media

</ArticleHeaderSection>

<ContentSection>

OpenArchive’s new guide, [Preserving Truth to Power](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLMsgSzn07qolxJCM-jdos6PICV_gjZy/view?usp=sharing), was created with and for citizen reporters and human rights defenders documenting injustice.

In it, we share best practices for how to ethically and safely store sensitive mobile media, such as evidence of human rights violations, social movements, or everyday citizen reporting. We also include a mini tutorial for how to do this by using our free, open source tool [**_Save_**](https://open-archive.org/save/) as well as share which long-term storage solutions are best when working with vulnerable sources to help them more safely preserve, protect, and amplify what they’ve documented.

### Learn:

- _who_ our work is for;
- _what_ mobile media you want to securely preserve;
- _when_ to use **_Save_**;
- _where_ your media goes;
- _why_ you need to archive evidence securely;
- _how_ you can safely preserve your mobile media.

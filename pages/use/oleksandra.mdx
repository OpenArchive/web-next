| ![](khpg.svg)    | Oleksandra works as a documenter and a database manager for KHPG.                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![](folder.svg)    | Oleksandra is based in Kharkiv. She spends around half her time working from home and the other half traveling eastern Ukraine for work.                                                                                   |
| ![](play.svg)      | Oleksandraâ€™s mode of connecting to the internet depends on where she is. While she prefers to connect via a secure WiFi network when she is managing databases and uploading content she has documented, she occasionally  |
|                    | relies on mobile data while she is traveling to a location to record evidence of hostilities.                                                                                                                              |
| ![](hands.svg)     | Oleksandra uses an iPhone to capture evidence and share information with others.                                                                                                                                           |
| ![](website.svg)   | Oleksandra receives media directly from sources, from documenters collecting OSINT (scraping media from social media and other public sites), and from physical documents submitted to her.                                |

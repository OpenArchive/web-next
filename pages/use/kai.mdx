| ![](hrw.svg)       | Kai is a researcher at Human Rights Watch.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ![](folder.svg)    | They are a legal expert on LGBT rights.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ![](play.svg)      | They interview victims and witnesses of human rights abuses.                                                                                                                                                            |
| ![](hands.svg)     | They are non-partisan, neutral, and professional observer who wants to hold accountable for their actions.                                                                                                              |
| ![](website.svg)   | After conducting thorough research, they create reports on the incident which are 50-150 pages long. In these reports, Kai describes their findings, documents how laws were broken, and provide their recommendations. |
| ![](checkmark.svg) | Kai is accompanied by one videographer on most occasions, but when that is not possible, they collect evidence on their cellphone.                                                                                      |
| ![](squares.svg)   | They then transfer the media to their laptop and uploads it over WiFi.                                                                                                                                                  |
| ![](squares.svg)   | Kai reaches out to communications and Media teams before publishing the report.                                                                                                                                         |

![](use-summary-pain.svg)

### Pain points

Low internet connectivity on the field leads to upload and sync problems while uploading content. File management and uploading data to collections are difficult for mobile devices. Data collected is in Gigabytes, transfer through mobile internet is inconvenient due to storage. Phone apps compress video, and can't be used for production. Moving mobile shot video on iPhone to a laptop for file management and upload/transfer.

### Solutions

The status bar will give researchers an indication of the percentage of uploads completed; Nearby shares. Integrating with backend, so it has metadata, proof mode. Discuss compression with HRW to see if it's an option to work with the compressed version sooner & get raw files later. iPad/IOS/Mac version of the app to facilitate uploading through various devices. Airdrop can make it easier to transfer files from mobile to iPad/Mac.

### Pain points

File management on mobile is difficult. Sensitive data sitting in the cloud. Absence of an established workflow for researchers. Lack of acknowledgment of the need for archivists. Receiving data physically or online depends on their security concern. Physical mail has complications based on the laws in the countries and takes time. Security concerns. Often hacked.

### Solutions

Media coming in will have proof mode, metadata - prepackaged info which will be useful for Anna. Different tags for incoming media will help to catalog data. A secure backend will reduce the dependency on receiving data through physical mail. Researchers will be able to start cataloging and describing the content, thus creating a workflow.

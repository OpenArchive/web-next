    ##### Decentralized Archivist Community (DAC) Partnerships

    We strive to dismantle silos and work alongside communities who share our goals toward achieving a more equitable and representative media landscape.

    We currently partner with many international and US-based communities (Decentralized Archivist Communities) who are creating robust, decentralized evidentiary archives. Through our partnerships we provide needs assessments, security and archival workshops, assistance with internal documentation and workflows, Save implementation and integration with their backend archives, as well as funding to support their archives.

    Contact us to learn more about becoming a DAC partner!

    ##### Decentralized Archivist Community (DAC) Partnerships

    We strive to dismantle silos and work alongside communities who share our goals toward achieving a more equitable and representative media landscape.

    We currently partner with many international and US-based communities (Decentralized Archivist Communities) who are creating robust, decentralized evidentiary archives. Through our partnerships we provide needs assessments, security and archival workshops, assistance with internal documentation and workflows, ***Save*** implementation and integration with their backend archives, as well as funding to support their archives.

    Contact us to learn more about becoming a DAC partner!

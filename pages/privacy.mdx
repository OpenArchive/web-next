### Terms & Privacy Policy

Effective as of June 5, 2019

Updated June 5, 2019

**_Save_** and OpenArchive are designed to never collect or store any sensitive information. Media preserved by the **_Save_** mobile application cannot be accessed by us or unauthorized third parties because there is no centralized database or server that manages your media and we use Orbot and Tor for private and secure data transmission between the application and the destination server. If you choose to use the Internet Archive or other public servers as a destination, the information you share with them such as your email address, media, metadata, etc. will be public. Our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are available below.

  You use our services at your own risk and subject to the following disclaimers. We provide our services on an “as is” basis without any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and freedom from computer virus or other harmful code. Save does not warrant that any information provided by us is accurate, complete, or useful, that our services will be operational, error-free, secure, or safe, or that our services will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections.

###### Limitation of liability. 
  
  The save parties will not be liable to you for any lost profits or consequential, special, punitive, indirect, or incidental damages relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with our terms, us, or our services, even if the save parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with our terms, us, or our services will not exceed one hundred dollars ($100). The foregoing disclaimer of certain damages and limitation of liability will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

Our Terms cover the entire agreement between you and **_Save_** regarding our Services. If you do not agree with our Terms, you should stop using our Services.
  
If we fail to enforce any of our Terms, that does not mean we waive the right to enforce them. If any provision of the Terms is deemed unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable from our Terms and shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions. Our Services are not intended for distribution to or use in any country where such distribution or use would violate local law or would subject us to any regulations in another country.

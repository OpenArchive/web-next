## About the **Position**

The mobile interaction designer will work closely with the Tech Lead and the Executive Director to guide the usability, design and feature improvements of our app **_Save_**. We expect the designer to have a robust toolkit and the flexibility to adapt to new technologies, in addition to having an evolved understanding of how people use their devices and how they use and want to use the **_Save_** app.

Usability is key when building secure tools as there is always a security-usability trade-off. This role will help us improve the usability and accessibility of our secure mobile archiving application **_Save_** so that it continues to be a leading human rights tool that prioritizes usability as much as privacy. Our larger goal is to show that secure tools can be so easy to use, they become the rule and not the exception. We strive to regularly incorporate new ux research findings into the app every few months, so this work will be ongoing and iterative.

The mobile interaction designer will work with the Executive, Tech, and QA teams to identify user flow / ux frictions in both Android and iOS versions of **_Save_**. They will then offer ux and design solutions, reporting back to our Tech Lead and the Executive Director. After critical user pathways are addressed, this role will then work with the Executive and Tech teams to create a spec / roadmap of improvements to implement as we further decentralize and add new features to the app.

## About the **Position**

To guide our development of decentralized archiving options within our app, **_Save_**, we’re seeking a researcher who can evaluate the needs of our archivist communities and the potential of various decentralized storage technologies to meet those needs.

We’re focused on making the app and archival process as easy as possible for Decentralized Archivist Communities (DAC’s) to use. Your focus will be to identify the affordances and threats of various decentralized storage technologies and analyze how they might be advantageous or harmful to our users.
Each community has varying privacy, security, durability, accessibility, and usability needs. Your job will be to work with archivist OpenArchive’s community managers, find the common threads, and identify their most pressing unmet needs.

You’ll use your understanding of both what’s needed and the trajectory of capabilities delivered by decentralized solutions to guide the design and development roadmap for **_Save_**. Some questions that need to be answered include:

- How does sharing a video file using IPFS look different on a network versus uploading it to a server using WebDAV? Would it set off red flags for a mobile network operator?
- Who can see when a file is published on IPFS, and are there any additional layers of access control or encryption that can be added, either within IPFS or on top of it?

We also need to consider how the perceived permanence of publishing something on the decentralized web, often seen as a feature, could also be harmful, if sensitive images or videos are accidentally released or need to be removed.

You’ll be expected to co-design research questions with OpenArchive leadership and investigate those questions independently. Figuring out what the right questions are the first step, answering them is the second, and sharing the findings with the OpenArchive team, and eventually the world, is the final outcome. You’ll publish your findings in appropriate forums along the way, be they academic journals, blogs, whitepapers, or internal reports.

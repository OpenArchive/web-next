## About the **Position**

We are seeking a Technology Manager to ensure our flagship [***Save***](https://open-archive.org/save) app is as up-to-date, secure, and easy-to-use as possible for our users and [Decentralized Archivist Communities](https://open-archive.org/programs) (DACs).

The Technology Manager is responsible for supporting the Technology Director’s work to ensure the success, functionality, and longevity of the ***Save***  app. The role is responsible for: technical documentation writing, coordinating and managing relationships with technical project partners such as Hypha/Distributed Press, Localization Lab (to ensure the app is localized in the many languages it needs to be in), as well as Security Auditors like OTF’s Security Lab, etc. 

Additionally, they will support the Technology Director’s oversight of user experience design, testing, and quality assurance processes and provide guidance and expertise to the OpenArchive Executive and Tech teams, as-needed.

We are seeking a highly engaged person with moderate experience in mobile development who is proficient with product and project management. A commitment to free and open-source software, good communication and documentation skills, and a passion for contributing to the greater good are all essential.

If able, we would love for this role to also contribute code to the Android and/or iOS code bases (as-needed) and any other related work to enhance the security, decentralization, and usability of the ***Save*** app, but this experience it not required for this role.

_If you have most of the required skills and experience, or could gain them with a little support, we would love to hear from you. Regardless of whether you have all of the required experience, please apply!_

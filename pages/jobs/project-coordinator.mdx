## About the **Position**

The Project Coordinator will work closely with the Executive Director and Deputy Director to guide OpenArchive’s operational and programmatic success. The Project Coordinator will undertake various administrative and programmatic tasks to support the team’s day-to-day operations, assist with grant seeking, and coordinate our Decentralized Archivist Community (DAC) partnerships and other programmatic initiatives.

The Program Coordinator’s work largely falls within three buckets of work:

- **Administration:** Including calendar management, coordinating board activities, booking travel, researching conferences, and managing, organizing, and maintaining spreadsheets and Google Drive folders.
- **Project Coordination:** Including coordinating with DAC managers, following and updating DAC timelines, assisting with needs assessment research, and coordinating our user experience and accessibility audit for our [**_Save_** app](https://open-archive.org/save).
- **Fundraising:** Including researching potential opportunities, assisting with drafting proposals, managing deadlines, and grant management support.

OpenArchive is experiencing rapid growth and programmatic expansion. This offers a unique opportunity to candidates beginning their careers in the human and digital rights space who are looking for growth. While the Program Coordinator will have defined responsibilities and tasks, there are opportunities for the Coordinator to delve deeper into areas of the work they are especially interested in and take on leadership roles in some of our projects.

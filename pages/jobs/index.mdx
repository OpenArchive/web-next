    OpenArchive co-develops responsive, secure, verifiable, and ethical archiving tools and resources with human rights defenders and NGOs to advance justice and accountability. We help people have more agency over the preservation, verification, and security of their mobile media. We are working on challenging, but compelling problems at the crux of privacy, usability, and long-term preservation of mobile media. If you are passionate about helping people create secure, robust, personal archives to preserve mobile media, especially media made by historically marginalized communities, or are just interested in making secure archiving tools more usable, check out our open positions.

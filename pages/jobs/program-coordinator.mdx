## About the **Position**

The Program Coordinator will work closely with the Executive Director and Deputy Director to guide OpenArchive’s operational and programmatic success. The Program Coordinator will undertake various administrative and programmatic tasks to support the team’s day-to-day operations, assist with grant seeking, and coordinate our Decentralized Archivist Community (DAC) partnerships and other programmatic initiatives.

The Program Coordinator’s work largely falls within five buckets of work: 

- **Program Coordination:** Including coordinating with DAC managers, following and updating DAC timelines, assisting with needs assessment research, and coordinating our user experience and accessibility audit for our [***Save*** app](https://open-archive.org/save).
- **Research:** Including designing and iterating on needs assessment and survey materials to conduct co-research with archivist and activist communities; analyzing and synthesizing qualitative data; developing user personas; contributing to data visualization efforts for blog posts and other communications products.
- **Editorial:** Including writing press releases, blog posts, and newsletters; copyediting comms products; contributing to reports for funders.
- **Administration:** Including calendar management, coordinating board activities, booking travel, researching conferences, and managing, organizing, and maintaining spreadsheets and Google Drive folders.
- **Fundraising:** Including researching potential opportunities, assisting with drafting proposals, managing deadlines, and grant management support.


OpenArchive is experiencing rapid growth and programmatic expansion. This offers a unique opportunity to candidates beginning their careers in the human and digital rights space who are looking for growth. While the Program Coordinator will have defined responsibilities and tasks, there are opportunities for the Coordinator to delve deeper into areas of the work they are especially interested in and take on leadership roles in some of our projects and programs.

And yet, many activists, journalists and eyewitnesses are storing precious pieces of history on the most fragile devices they own. The media itself is also ephemeral, as new threats to digital media arise.\n\n</BeliefsSection>\n<MissionSection>\n    ## Our **Mission**\n\n    OpenArchive is dedicated to protecting media freedom by helping eyewitnesses preserve truth to power. We've created a distributed media archiving ecosystem that enables human rights defenders to share, archive, verify, and encrypt their evidentiary media.\n\n    History's first responders are amassing rich, contextualized, and crucial records of today's breaking news. However, most of these recordings presently reside on social media platforms that can chill free speech and are subject to censorship, privacy breaches, and data loss. While social media is an acceptable distribution platform, it does not provide sufficient privacy protections or archival preservation of this vital media.\n\n    ##### We are doing better.\n\n    Created by and for eyewitnesses and human rights defenders in 2015, OpenArchive fosters a more just, equitable, and sustainable media ecosystem where people's history is the primary history.\n\n</MissionSection>\n<VisionSection>\n    ## **Our vision**\n\n    To create a more just, equitable, and sustainable media ecosystem where people's history is the primary history.\n\n</VisionSection>\n<ActivitiesSection>\n    ## What **we do**\n\n    <ActivityItem>\n        ![](AboutUs/about-us-2.png)\n\n        ##### Build tools\n\n    </ActivityItem>\n    <ActivityItem>\n        ![](what-conduct.png)\n\n        ##### Conduct research\n\n    </ActivityItem>\n    <ActivityItem>\n        ![](AboutUs/about-us-3.png)\n\n        ##### Publish reports\n\n    </ActivityItem>\n    <ActivityItem>\n        ![](what-archive.png)\n\n        ##### Archive essential media\n\n    </ActivityItem>\n    <ActivityItem>\n        ![](AboutUs/about-us-4.png)\n\n        ##### Document activities\n\n    </ActivityItem>\n\n</ActivitiesSection>\n<PartnersSection>\n    ## **Who** we are\n\n    <TeamItem>\n        OpenArchive is dedicated to protecting media freedom: preserving, amplifying, and securely routing mobile media to community-maintained collections in accessible public and private archives, outside the corporate walled gardens currently dominating the online media ecosystem.

We’ve created a distributed media archiving ecosystem that enables human rights defenders to share, archive, verify, and encrypt their evidentiary media. We conduct co-research, build tools, and create guides that advance human rights every day.\n    \n      Created by and for eyewitnesses and human rights defenders in 2015, OpenArchive fosters a more just, equitable, and sustainable media ecosystem where people's history is the primary history.\n\n  </QuestionItem>\n\n  <QuestionItem>\n      ### What is ***Save***?\n\n    ***Save*** (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) is a free, open-source, secure-mobile application built with and for eyewitnesses and human rights defenders. ***Save*** securely sends mobile media to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) and other online and offline destinations using Orbot/Tor. OpenArchive unites the work of the [Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/), [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/), [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), and distributed secure servers. It offers at-risk groups more agency over their historical record by affording them secure transit, media authentication, pseudonymity, licensing controls, and the ability to choose where and how the media will be stored for long-term access and reuse.\n\n    ***Save*** helps you store, share, and amplify your mobile media while ensuring your identity remains protected. It's also freely available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/save-by-openarchive/id1462212414) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.opendasharchive.openarchive.release). With ***Save***, you can add metadata and [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licensing to your audio or visual mobile media, then send it over TLS and the privacy-focused [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) network to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) or other private archives to be saved.\n    \n    ***Save*** protects free speech by leveraging a suite of privacy-enhancing technologies to safeguard your media and identity in the event of internet shutdowns, surveillance, device confiscations, content takedowns, limited bandwidth, and data loss. It also assures continued access to your saved media for years to come.\n\n  </QuestionItem>\n  <QuestionItem>\n    ### What can ***Save*** do?\n\n    ***Save*** is committed to usability and digital inclusion. Unlike other media-sharing tools, it offers responsive features that streamline secure preservation based on participatory research and co-design with communities we serve. With ***Save*** you can:\n\n    **Authenticate Media**: With ***Save***, you ensure your media is always authenticated because you have full control—without interference from intermediaries—from phone to archive. And, when paired with ProofMode (available now for Android, iOS coming soon), you can even add sensor data to corroborate the metadata captured alongside your media.\n\n    **Secure Transit**: ***Save*** always uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to ensure in-transit security and encryption. When you enable Tor for mobile (either via Orbot: Tor for Android or Onion Browser for iOS), you add an additional layer of protection to ensure no one intercepts your media as it travels from your phone to the Internet Archive or your server of choice.\n\n    **Long-Term Preservation**: When you use ***Save*** to archive your mobile media in a trusted archive (such as the Internet Archive or OwnCloud), you ensure unobstructed access for generations to come. This is in stark contrast to popular social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, which aren’t committed to long-term media preservation.\n\n    **Licensing**: With ***Save*** you can communicate your intentions for future use by easily generating a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) license in-app allowing others to reuse or modify your work.\n\n    **Stay Organized**: ***Save***'s easy-to-use design allows teams and individuals to seamlessly streamline media from many phones into organized folders specific to each contributor.\n\n    **Add Metadata**: ***Save*** lets you add metadata like location, people, and notes to your archived media.\n\n    **Flag Significant Content**: You can flag certain media as “significant” to alert reviewers that this folder contains sensitive/violent media or just use it as a “favorites” folder.\n\n    **Import Media**: ***Save*** allows you to import and share media from other apps on your phone, including audio, notes, and pdf files.\n\n    **Improve Redundancy**: With ***Save*** you can further protect your media by creating and storing multiple copies on different secure servers. Whether hosting locally or remotely, your data can be encrypted on the backend and only accessible by who you want. \n\n    **View Progress**: When storing media via ***Save***, you can view how much content has been uploaded.\n\n    **Prioritize Uploads**: prioritize particular media to upload first over others (e.g., order the smallest files first and largest files last).\n\n  </QuestionItem>\n  <QuestionItem>\n    ### What can't ***Save*** do?\n    \n    Although ***Save*** offers a suite of many unique features, it’s no silver bullet. When using the app, please be aware of the following limitations:\n\n    ***Save*** **does not provide storage or server space**: You will need to set up your own WebDav-compatible server (such as Nextcloud, etc.), or use the Internet Archive (free) or DropBox to create and store your collections.\n\n    ***Save*** **does not provide on-device encryption**: ***Save*** does not store your media; it only stores thumbnails from your camera roll, which are not currently encrypted in the app. Once organized into projects and uploaded to the server, all media is sent over an encrypted connection. We recommend that you also encrypt your server for enhanced security.\n\n    ***Save*** **does not delete original copies of media from your camera roll**: Once media is sent to a server, you can then delete the thumbnails from the ***Save*** app if you choose. The original content will remain in your camera roll (unless you remove it).\n\n    ***Save*** **does not have an in-app killswitch**: Uninstalling ***Save*** will remove all local copies of media/metadata stored in the app and all local configurations and settings, including account information.\n  </QuestionItem>\n  <QuestionItem>\n    ### Is OpenArchive the Internet Archive?\n\n    No, OpenArchive collaborates with the Internet Archive, but is an independent project.\n\n    The Internet Archive is a nonprofit digital library offering free universal access to books, movies, and music, as well as almost a trillion archived web pages.\n\n    OpenArchive is a project dedicated to the ethical collection and long-term preservation of mobile media. ***Save*** (share, archive, verify, encrypt) is the mobile application we’ve created to do this. ***Save*** enables people to send media to multiple places, including the Internet Archive and other destinations of their choice. This option also enables people to create public or private media collections.\n\n  </QuestionItem>\n  <QuestionItem>\n    ### Why not social media?\n\n    Although social media platforms are an easy place to house photos and videos, these platforms lack critical security safeguards and are subject to state censorship and content takedowns from the companies themselves. Use ***Save*** to avoid these pitfalls:\n\n    **Social media often exposes at-risk sources**: Although major social media platforms can amplify content by exposing it to a large audience, these platforms can also expose sources to unwanted identification. Individuals shown or otherwise implicated in videos, photos, or audio clips may be targeted both online and offline. \n\n    **Social media can make it difficult to authenticate or verify media**: Social media sites often strip metadata (info about where and how media was captured) from uploaded content. While this feature enhances privacy, the practice also makes media authentication and verification more difficult.\n\n    **Media gets lost on social media platforms**: Within a sea of content, it is difficult to contextualize or organize media for easy access in the future.\n\n    **Social Media is not committed to long-term preservation**: Companies moderate content, take down media, and go out of business.\n\n  </QuestionItem>\n  <QuestionItem>\n    ### Who is ***Save*** for?\n\n    We designed ***Save*** with and for individuals and organizations across the globe, including:\n\n    **Human rights organizations** collecting evidence of abuse;\n\n    **Academic organizations** accepting targeted or sensitive media from the field;\n\n    **Journalists and news organizations** receiving sensitive media from vulnerable sources whose identity and personal details must be protected from interception;\n\n    **Archivists and librarians** working to create community collections at the Internet Archive or other digital libraries; and\n\n    **Individuals, freelance documentarians, and citizen journalists/eyewitnesses** interested in organizing and curating their own mobile media collections.\n\n  </QuestionItem>\n  <QuestionItem>\n    ### Why use ***Save*** by OpenArchive?\n    \n    ***Save*** **helps combat common threats, including**:\n\n    **Loss of data**: Both digital and analog data face ongoing threats, (e.g. theft, manipulation, surveillance, sabotage, or intentional destruction), loss (e.g. hard drive failure or misplaced USB stick), and incidental destruction (e.g. natural disaster, water-based damage, or mold). ***Save*** helps protect against these threats by providing a way to create multiple backups of important data and distribute them across geographically and jurisdictionally diverse servers.\n\n    **Single point of failure**: Keeping data in just one place increases the likelihood that any of the above scenarios may lead to an inability to use or access your data. With ***Save***, you can connect and send media to multiple storage servers so that if one fails, the data will still be available elsewhere.\n\n    **Network surveillance and censorship**: People often want to protect their content, identity, and/or activities from those who may be watching them (like governments, private companies, or untrustworthy individuals). ***Save*** hardens your network connection by always employing TLS (Transport Layer Security) and the Tor network via Orbot (for Android, iOS coming soon), which promotes privacy by encrypting data transfers and protecting against traffic analysis.\n\n    **Inauthentic or unverified content**: Unverified content can lead to false conclusions and damage credibility. ***Save*** always uses SHA-256 hashes and incorporates [ProofMode](https://proofmode.org/) (for Android, coming soon for iOS), a feature that supports robust verification and authentication practices.\n\n  </QuestionItem>\n  <QuestionItem>\n    ### How can I support OpenArchive?\n\n    Our work is critical and ongoing. If you would like to help fund our efforts, you can now make a [tax-deductible donation](/donate) thanks to our fiscal sponsor, [Media Alliance](https://media-alliance.org).\n\nThere are other ways you can help too.

Hundreds of thousands of troops are closing in on Ukraine, with explosions reported in Kyiv and other cities. The multi-pronged assault is an act of military aggression that hasn’t been seen in Europe in decades.\n\nUkraine once again is pushed into the spotlight of imperial interests and debate.\nSo how did we get here? The history is complex, and not easy to fit into a headline or Tweet, so navigating the news and updates surrounding Ukraine can be a challenge for those who aren’t already invested.\n\nWe spoke to Eastern Europe editor for Global Voices [Dr. Tanya Lokot](https://globalvoices.org/author/tetyana-lokot/) on how to read the news around the conflict. Lokot, who is Ukrainian herself, has been a Global Voices contributor since 2013. Lokot’s research predominantly focuses on the role of digital media in post-Soviet Europe.\n\n**Here are some tools to help you look beyond the headlines:**\n\n![Navigating the news around Russia's attack on Ukraine](ukraine-2.png)\n\n### Understand The Historical Context First\n\nLike any global conflict, the tension between Russia and Ukraine did not happen overnight.\n\n“Don't just think of it as a board game where things are moving every day on the chessboard,” Lokot said. “It's not really just about how many thousands of troops are at the border, but it's trying to understand well, where does this all come from?”\n\nUkraine was part of - or occupied by, depending on who is telling the story – the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union for centuries before regaining independence in 1991 following the collapse of the USSR. There have been tensions between Ukraine’s old ties with Russia and its allegiances with the West ever since.\n\n![Timeline of Russia's attack on Ukraine](ukraine-3.jpg)\n\nIn 2014, Ukrainians took to the streets and toppled pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, demanding their independence and sovereignty. The Russian government meanwhile has consistently held the position that Ukraine is part of Russia. In 2014, Russian troops invaded Donbas and annexed Crimea, the biggest land grab in Europe since World War II.\n\nToday we see the escalation of war and the threat of further invasion of Ukraine.\nWhile Ukraine is the subject of the conversation, its people aren’t often centered in media reporting, which instead focuses on geopolitics between Russia and the U.S. and other Western European countries.\n\n“Ukraine is a country that has fought for recognition as a state for many, many years. And it's always been kind of smooshed in between these various imperial powers,” Lokot said.\n\nLokot suggests people listen to more Ukrainian voices and sources when trying to understand the issue.\n\n“Understand why Ukrainians are so upset about somebody else trying to make decisions for them and why are they also upset when it's being framed as a conflict between Russia and NATO or Russia and the West? It's like, well, what about us?”\n\nFor more historical context, Lokot suggests checking out the [Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University](https://huri.harvard.edu/), which has online resources and guides on the relationship between Russia and Ukraine. [The Ukraine Forum at the Chatham House](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/our-departments/russia-and-eurasia-programme/ukraine-forum) also offers helpful insight on the political dynamics of Ukraine.\n\n### What To Consider When Reading U.S. and Other Foreign Media\n\nAmerican journalists have been put into the awkward position of trying to explain the United States’ role in Ukraine while contending with the country’s dark past in getting involved in other global conflicts. “I think this colors both what U.S. officials say and how they say it and also how the U.S. media is reporting it,” Lokot said.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the U.S. showed itself to be inept at combating corruption and insurgency. President Joe Biden’s perceived diplomatic failure in Afghanistan after pulling out the rest of the American troops now [hovers over the media coverage in Ukraine](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/afghanistan-hovers-bidens-strategy-ukraine-rcna16403) as well.\n\nWestern, particularly U.S. media, coverage of the conflict has been widely critical of President Vladimir Putin’s aggression toward Ukraine, but there have been a few blunders as they fall into Russia’s false flag campaign of “will they or won’t they” invade.\n\nThe constant flow of unverified and misleading information has made reporting the truth difficult for journalists. The Russian government especially has a track record of using social media to spread misinformation.\n\nThere are language and cultural barriers as well, Lokot said, citing the example of when Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy [cracked a joke about the date of the invasion](https://www.vox.com/2022/2/14/22933850/ukraine-war-february-16-zelensky-prediction-jokeZelensky) and Western media reported it as fact.\n\n#### Russian coverage of the aggression\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian state media tactics are aimed at popularizing the idea that Ukraine should be under Russia’s control anyway, and that Russia’s current aggression is just a pretext to circulate this idea, Lokot said.\n\nEven though Ukraine isn’t part of NATO, U.S. funding and support have played a significant role in Ukraine’s current form of government, but this same fact is used by Putin to discredit Ukraine as a true democracy, she added.\n\nMessaging on the Russian side of things has also been mixed. In the past few weeks, “they've been gleeful at U.S. predictions (of an invasion) not coming true, but also saying that Russia can indeed invade any day and possibly should,” she said. Now that Russia has declared Donetsk and Luhansk “independent regions” and has moved into Donbas, we’re seeing Putin’s flirtation with invasion becoming reality. Russia has now launched attacks on Ukraine on multiple fronts in multiple cities, including Kyiv. The broad offensive has already killed dozens.\n\n### Pause Before You Share\n\nAs tensions boil over and headlines scream about the invasion, it’s easy to retweet or reshare updates without always verifying where they come from, particularly if it's news that aligns with your current perception of events.\n\nIt’s also important to pay attention to the language used in articles and posts. [A lot of Ukranians have been critical about some of the language used in headlines and articles from English-speaking news outlets.](https://twitter.com/ukraine_world/status/1493939556344815620) For example, calling Russia's attack on Ukraine a “civil war,” or using the Russian spelling or Ukraine’s capital (Kiev) instead of the Ukrainian spelling (Kyiv).\n\nLokot advises readers to take a pause and consider where the information is coming from, and whether the information stated is conjecture or fact. Ask yourself the following questions: “Even if the media outlet is reputable, are they citing any sources? What are those sources? If they're saying that there's evidence, is there any actual evidence? Is there a video? Is there a photo? Is there a map?”\n\n### Question the Source\n\nThere have been quite a few self-proclaimed “experts” on Ukraine who have come out of the woodwork over the past several weeks. Before you take their word for it, it’s worth doing a bit more digging.\n\n“If I see a name that's unfamiliar to me, who is trying to be an authority on something, at the very least, I go and see who this person is and what their affiliation is,” Lokot said.\n\n### Still Stumped? Here Are Some Sources to Follow:\n\n![Follow credible sources to navigate the news of Russia's aggression in Ukraine](ukraine-4.jpg)\n\nUkrainian voices are often missing in news stories about their own country.

KHPG documents, preserves, and uses evidentiary media to hold Russia accountable for its war crimes and bring justice to the Ukrainian people. \n\nThis partnership bolsters KHPG’s work by supporting a decentralized archivist community of journalists, historians, lawyers, and other on-the-ground eyewitnesses to facilitate trainings on best practices for archiving and digital security in active war zones. \n\n“Collaborating with KHPG to protect and preserve their crucial evidence is one of the most important and rewarding projects I’ve had the good fortune to work on,” said OpenArchive Founder & Executive Director Natalie Cadranel. “Their indestructible spirit, technological capabilities, and brilliant, dedicated team have shown incredible fortitude under extreme duress. Their commitment to exposing injustice and protecting human rights is truly inspirational.”\n\nUkrainian authorities and international human rights groups are already investigating thousands of alleged war crimes since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. These crimes include [sexual violence](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/30/1093339262/ukraine-russia-rape-war-crimes), [summary execution](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/05/18/ukraine-executions-torture-during-russian-occupation), [looting](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61643533), [forced displacement](https://khpg.org/en/1608811212), and [countless other cases of abuse](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/05/18/ukraine-executions-torture-during-russian-occupation). Preserving evidence of these atrocities can aid in advancing the prosecution of these crimes and bringing closure to grieving families. \n\n“We must bring justice to the Ukrainian victims of Russian atrocities,” said KHPG Director Yevgeniy Zakharov. “It is crucial to document these horrific war crimes and ensure we preserve and verify this evidence effectively and securely. OpenArchive is playing a critical role to help us bolster this process. With their help, we are able to implement more streamlined ways to document war crimes with new technologies and create a more robust and secure archive. Our partnership is invaluable.”\n\nKHPG is one of the oldest and most active non-governmental human rights organizations in Ukraine. The group documents human/civil rights abuses in Ukraine by recording [interviews with victims](https://khpg.org/en/1309) and eyewitnesses of Russian war crimes and collecting [evidence from open sources](https://khpg.org/en/1608811231). KHPG also offers legal assistance to victims of the atrocities, bringing cases to the International Criminal Court and other international institutions.\n\nIn March 2022, KHPG joined the [Tribunal for Putin (T4P)](https://t4pua.org/en/1084) global initiative alongside other human rights organizations to help collect open-source intelligence of Russian war crimes. 24 participating organizations specializing in specific regions verify and authenticate details from open sources while also gathering testimony from witnesses and victims. One of the members of the initiative, the Center for Civil Liberties, recently received [the Nobel Peace prize 2022](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2022/press-release/).\n\n“Behind each documented war crime, there is someone’s life that Russia ruined, traumatized, or claimed forever. Russia needs to be held accountable… We must help Ukrainians document Russia’s war crimes so that they will not repeat anywhere in the world,” said Viktoriia Savchuk, OpenArchive’s community manager for Ukraine. \n\nOpenArchive uses a [human rights centered co-research and design approach](https://www.humanrightscentered.design/) to work with communities worldwide to develop safer and usable mobile archiving tools and workflows. \n\nBeyond Ukraine, OpenArchive is partnering with [Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs)](https://open-archive.org/news/archiving-forward-part-2) worldwide to preserve evidence of war crimes, injustice, police brutality, and violence from far-right extremists. OpenArchive supports its DACs with funding, ethnographic research to learn about their needs and pain points, by sharing technical expertise about best practices for creating and maintaining a secure archive, and training them on how to use [***Save***](https://open-archive.org/save) to protect and simplify their archival workflows. \n\nOpenArchive developed its ***Save*** (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app in 2015 to circumvent these obstacles. ***Save*** helps eyewitnesses preserve, protect, authenticate, and amplify crucial records of human rights abuses by routing their media to secure servers and public digital collections like the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). \n\n\n*Photo by: Алесь Усцінаў / Pexels*\n\n\n</ContentSection>\n","news/archiving-forward-part-2":"---\ntitle: Archiving Forward Part 2 - Mapping Our Decentralized Ecosystem\ndescription: How we build our organizational infrastructure for action\ndate: 10/03/22\ncategory: Blogs\nimage: archiving-forward-part2.png\n---\n\nimport { ArticleHeaderSection } from \"components/news/ArticleHeaderSection\";\nimport { ContentSection } from \"components/news/ContentSection\";\n\n<ArticleHeaderSection>\n![](archiving-forward-part2.png)\n\n{date}\n\n{category}\n\n## Archiving Forward Part 2 - Mapping Our Decentralized Ecosystem\n\nHow we build our organizational infrastructure for action\n\n\n</ArticleHeaderSection>\n<ContentSection>\n\n“Power to the people” is as much an organizational strategy as it is a rallying cry. \n\nFrom the [post-coup resistance](https://thediplomat.com/2021/10/resistance-attacks-on-myanmar-junta-growing-in-frequency-intensity/) in Myanmar, to [anti-fascist movements](http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/syndicated/opposition-violent-supremacy-varied-decentralized-nature-collective-self-defense/) in North America and Europe, the age of the internet and digital literacy among the masses drives home a more radical form of people power. \n\nWe know that anyone with a smartphone can expose global injustice, but the irreplaceable moments we capture on our phones are fragile and ephemeral. Oftentimes, the only other versions of this evidentiary media reside on social media platforms that — while extremely effective in amplifying social causes and primary accounts of injustice — can chill free speech through [content takedowns](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/05/amid-systemic-censorship-palestinian-voices-facebook-owes-users-transparency), [government censorship](https://time.com/6139988/countries-where-twitter-facebook-tiktok-banned/), and [privacy breaches](https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4). Social media also does not provide sufficient privacy protections or archival preservation of this irreplaceable media.\n\nThat’s why archival activists like ourselves are embracing more decentralized organizational models and technologies to ensure redundancy and accessibility. \n\nThis second part of our three-part “Archiving Forward” series will talk about our decentralized ecosystem, and how community organizations, tech developers, and everyday civilians each play a critical role in preserving, amplifying, and securely routing significant records of social movements, state violence, and human rights atrocities. \n\nThe tech industry's exploitation of its “users'\" content, data, and privacy signals the need for an accessible public trust, outside the corporate walled gardens currently dominating the online media ecosystem. Archiving Forward refers to a bottom-up framework that brings autonomy back to the capturer. \n\nFrom the decentralized archivists who collect evidence of human rights atrocities to the collaborators and volunteers who build and contribute to our tools, to the stewards who amplify our work, we all have a hand in preserving truth to power.\n\n\n### Decentralized Archivists\n\nWe aren’t interested in creating a centralized archive at OpenArchive. Instead, we are cultivating decentralized, redundant, secure, robust, verifiable, and accessible archives that center the communities we work with. \n\nWe use a human rights centered co-research and design process to work with communities worldwide, which we refer to as Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs). These DACs are made up of citizen journalists, legal observers, historians, and civilian eyewitnesses who capture and store critical evidence of war crimes, far-right militia activities, police violence, and other human rights abuses. This evidence is often stored on the most fragile devices they own – their phones. \n\nThere are countless tools and resources for the creation and capture of digital media. We are in a moment where we need to demystify the preservation of this content. That’s why we are training communities in Ukraine, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Latin America, and the U.S. on how to use our tools and safeguard their mobile media. \n\nFor example in Ukraine, we already have folks on the ground documenting Russian war crimes and creating robust, verifiable, and accessible archives to bring accountability and justice. We are partnering with the [Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group [KHPG)](https://khpg.org/en/1489698549) to facilitate trainings on best practices for archiving and digital security in active war zones. In Philadelphia, PA, and Portland, OR, we are helping communities preserve evidence of social injustice, particularly violence from police and far-right militias.\n\nOpenArchive and these DACs are implementing a robust, redundant, and interoperable archiving workflow. We are working with a number of communities that are already using our tools to create their own archives. Our goal is to engage more deeply with them by conducting collaborative research, educational outreach, and digital security trainings.\n\n\n### Our Partners\n\nThe role that individuals, small community organizations, and International NGOs play to create impactful archives cannot be overstated.  We saw this in the Democratic Republic of Congo, when in 2018, two commanders of the rebel militia, Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda [received life sentences](https://www.witness.org/video-evidence-helps-lead-to-historic-conviction-in-democratic-republic-of-congo/) for murder and torture after video evidence was used to expose their crimes against humanity. \n\nEfforts to collect, archive, and verify this crucial evidentiary media were the result of a close collaboration between both individuals and NGOs like [TRIAL International](https://trialinternational.org/), [WITNESS](https://www.witness.org/), and [eyeWitness to Atrocities](https://www.eyewitness.global/). \n\nThe scope of our work cannot be achieved without mission-aligned partner organizations that share our goals to achieve a more just, equitable, and sustainable media ecosystem where the people's history is the primary history. \n\nOur collaboration with [Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/) enabled us to launch our ***Save*** (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app. The partnership provided us with the technologists and usability expertise we needed to make ***Save*** an easy-to-use, secure archiving tool that empowers users to circumvent threats to free speech such as device confiscation, network blocking, doxxing, surveillance, and more.\n\nSecure, interoperable, and privacy-minded tools are often inaccessible and unusable for small community organizations and everyday civilians. That’s where larger, well-resourced organizations or “stewards” come into play. Through our decentralized partnerships, we are leveraging our expertise and resources to demystify and adjust our tools and be more responsive to the communities they serve. Because ***Save*** is open source, others can adapt the app to fit their needs. \n\nOver the past decade, we’ve conducted co-research with diverse communities worldwide to help us identify what critical features to add to our ***Save*** app. This research helped us to ensure the app is tailored to the communities who need it most. We intentionally developed ***Save*** as an [open source](https://github.com/openarchive) application so that it can be modified by anyone to better adapt the features to their needs.\n\nOnce we realized there was a need for ***Save*** within larger human rights NGOs, we partnered with [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/) to scope community needs, create personas, and adapt it for them, and ideally, other larger NGOs with similar needs. ***Save*** provides HRW with fully encrypted and self-hosted file transfer mapped to their archive for their international team. Partners like HRW act as our steward by using our tools and amplifying our guides and research with their communities, as well as sustaining the development of our work. Through collaboration, they help us adapt the tool and sustain our development work over time.\n\n\nArchival institutions like the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) provide free access to decades of digitized historical records. Our ***Save*** app utilizes the Internet Archive as an optional public back-end in addition to connecting to private, secure, open-source servers so people have more control over who has access to their media collections.\n\nOpenArchive also unites the work of [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/), [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), and distributed secure servers like [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)  to offer at-risk groups more agency over their historical record by affording them secure transit, media authentication, pseudonymity, licensing controls, and the ability to choose where and how the media will be stored. \n\n\n  \n### Volunteers and In-Kind Support \n\nVolunteers and organizations that provide in-kind support are invaluable to the OpenArchive ecosystem. Global programs and educational institutions like [Internews’ BASICS program](https://internews.org/areas-of-expertise/global-tech/global-tech-projects/basics/) , [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), and the [UC Berkeley School of Information](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/)  provide us paid contractors who specialize in programming, research, user experience, documentation, graphic design, data science, marketing, and user advocacy.\n\n[Localization Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/) fills a critical role to help us translate and localize our research, guides and technology to make it more accessible for a global user base. \n\nOur volunteer-run advisory board is also instrumental in supporting our organization’s fundraising, communications and programmatic strategy. \n\nIf you are passionate about helping people create secure, robust, personal archives to preserve mobile media, especially media  made by historically marginalized communities, or are just interested in making secure archiving tools more usable, send us an email at info[at]open-archive.org.\n\n\n</ContentSection>\n","news/archiving-forward":"---\ntitle: Archiving Forward Part 1 - Demystifying the Cloud\ndescription: Learn about what the benefits of drawbacks of preserving your media in the cloud\ndate: 02/16/21\ncategory: Blogs\nimage: archiving-forward-part1.png\n---\n\nimport { ArticleHeaderSection } from \"components/news/ArticleHeaderSection\";\nimport { ContentSection } from \"components/news/ContentSection\";\n\n<ArticleHeaderSection>\n![](archiving-forward-part1.png)\n\n{date}\n\n{category}\n\n## Archiving Forward Part 1 - Demystifying the Cloud\n\nLearn about what the benefits of drawbacks of preserving your media in the cloud\n\n</ArticleHeaderSection>\n<ContentSection>\n\nThere are countless tools and resources for the creation and capture of digital media. Now we take time to demystify the preservation process for this content. Our “Archiving Forward” blog series will explore and explain how different actors, from individuals, to community organizations, to technology providers, each play critical roles in preserving, amplifying, and securely sending significant and impactful mobile media to their destinations.\n\nArchiving Forward refers to a framework for bringing autonomy back to the capturer, through user-created collections in an accessible public trust or private server, outside the corporate walled gardens currently dominating the online media ecosystem.\n\n[](021521_CloudSolutions_Quote.png)\n\nWhen we began researching and prototyping our mobile application for ethical preservation (what is now **_Save_**) back in 2013, we discovered four key challenges facing organizations interested in managing mobile media:\n\n- Few initiatives to collective mobile media;\n- No easy way to preserve or license mobile media;\n- Pressing privacy considerations; and\n- A lack of resources.\n\nLooking back, it is astonishing how quickly technological innovation has been able to mitigate these key challenges. In particular, the advent of the cloud, and adjacent [open source technologies](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) and documentation, make the task of preservation much more affordable and accessible than it used to be.\n\nFor the first entry in our Archiving Forward series, we will demystify the “cloud”: what it is, the benefits and drawbacks of using it to share and store media, and how we are utilizing it within the human rights community. We will also discuss why we chose Nextcloud as our preferred cloud backend.\n\n### What is the cloud?\n\nA cloud is a type of server, so in order to understand the cloud, it is\nhelpful to be familiar with the term “**server**.” A server is a computer,\nor a computer program, that manages access to a centralized resource or\nservice in a network. A server’s function is to store, retrieve and send\ncomputer files and data to other computers on a network - so the more\ncomputers and files you have that are regularly accessing a central body, the\nmore important it becomes to ensure that these interactions are secure and\neasily accessible.\n\nThe following infographic via [NSA's cloud security basics](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Jul/16/2002158059/-1/-1/0/CSI-CLOUD-SECURITY-BASICS.PDF?mod=article_inline) illustrates the various forms that the cloud can take:\n\n[](021521_CloudSolutions_Forms.png)\n\n### What are the main benefits of storing media in the cloud for the Human Rights Community?\n\nAt OpenArchive our mission is to prioritize usability and privacy in our tools. Cloud-based storage considerably minimizes the cost of securely storing and sharing digital content, without requiring highly technical expertise and training. This way, public interest organizations, as well as individuals, can easily run, manage, and maintain a server. Additional benefits include:\n\n- **Improved privacy & security**: some cloud services offer multiple layers of encryption and allow managers to set user controls, enabling them to choose who has access to the media on the cloud, as well as their level of access;\n- **More affordable than a local server**: the cloud is relatively inexpensive over time;\n- **Easier to use**: the UI (user interface) doesn’t require any coding knowledge and there is ample technical support available; and\n- **More accessible**: all organizations need in order to access and manage the cloud is an internet connection.\n\nHowever, not all cloud services are equal when it comes to security and privacy, there are key privacy risks involved when using the cloud.\n\n- _While the cloud has benefits for organizations with less sensitive media, those housing media that can put people at risk of prosecution or violence if leaked, should consider only having offline, redundant servers._\n\n[](021521_CloudSolutions_Benefits_vs_Risks.png)\n\n### What are the key risks when using the cloud?\n\nThe two primary risks people face when using the cloud are malicious adversary activity (i.e. hacking/data breaches) and unintentional configuration flaws. To reiterate, we strongly recommend those with highly sensitive media (i.e. whistleblowers, media organizations, legal advocates, etc.) use local, offline, physical servers.\n\n- _Data breaches_: Large companies are more likely to be targeted by hackers; and\n- _Configuration flaws_: Large companies with big servers handling multiple tasks are more susceptible to coding errors and other issues that are out of the control of the individuals or organizations that rely on them.\n\nNow that we’ve highlighted some benefits and risks of using the cloud, we recommend taking the following features into consideration when choosing a remote cloud storage solution.\n\n[](021521_CloudSolutions_Recommendations.png)\n\n### Why did we choose Nextcloud as a preferred private backend for **_Save_**?\n\nWe chose to include Nextcloud as one of **_Save's_** backends because they offer self-hosting, prioritize encryption, are committed to usability, and have a consistent privacy policy. It is easy to use both remotely and locally, and is the most secure option, especially if people maintain their local own servers. Additionally, [Nextcloud offers three layers of encryption on their servers](https://nextcloud.com/encryption/) making it less vulnerable to hackers than other cloud services. These are cornerstones of the **_Save_** project, which ensures media files are accessed, stored and shared securely.\n\n### Do any other cloud backends work with **_Save_**\n\n**_Save_** not only integrates with open source cloud services like Nextcloud, but also features the ability to save media to both the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) and Dropbox backends, as well.\n\nBy offering 3 different types of backends to use with **_Save_**, our goal is to support people’s varying storage needs. We will be including more as new options for secure, distributed storage emerge. In addition to Nextcloud, an open source cloud and physical server private backend, **_Save_** is also compatible with DropBox because it is more widely-used and accessible as many already have accounts (but offers less security), and the Internet Archive, a public backend committed to interoperability that guarantees your media is accessible online and in the future as formats evolve.\n\nWhile the cloud is no silver bullet, we believe Nextcloud is the best option for human rights defenders managing collections of sensitive mobile media who lack the capacity to host and maintain their own servers.\n\n</ContentSection>\n","news/congress-privacy-bill":"---\ntitle: What you need to know about the United States’ latest privacy bill \ndescription: A federal privacy bill may give Americans more control over their data but does not go far enough and would weaken existing state protections.\ndate: 09/08/22\ncategory: Blogs\nimage: usprivacybill.jpeg\n---\n\nimport { ArticleHeaderSection } from \"components/news/ArticleHeaderSection\";\nimport { ContentSection } from \"components/news/ContentSection\";\n\n<ArticleHeaderSection>\n![](usprivacybill.jpeg)\n\n{date}\n\n{category}\n\n## What you need to know about the United States’ latest privacy bill \n\nA federal privacy bill may give Americans more control over their data but does not go far enough and would weaken existing state protections. \n\n</ArticleHeaderSection>\n<ContentSection>\n\nThe U.S. Legislature is the closest it has ever been to passing a federal data privacy law with the recent draft of the bipartisan [American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA)]( https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8152/text). \n\nAmericans are long overdue for a federal privacy law. While the ADPPA does contain some good policies – particularly for states that don’t already have strong online privacy regulation – the bill in its current form could weaken or even strip away existing privacy protections in states like California which have robust privacy laws.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\n### Who does the ADPPA regulate?\n\nThe ADPPA broadly applies to organizations and companies operating in the United States, including corporations and nonprofits. The draft bill [defines](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8152/text) “covered entities'' as anyone who “collects, processes, or transfers covered data and is subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act.” This means big tech giants, like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, that mine sensitive information from millions of Americans would theoretically see unprecedented federal regulations.\n\n### First, the good parts about the bill:\n\n- It requires data collection to be as minimal as possible.\n- It allows individuals to opt-out of “transfers of covered data,” limiting some forms of [targeted marketing](https://www.wired.com/story/american-data-privacy-protection-act-adppa/). \n- It gives users the right to correct inaccuracies and potentially delete personal data collected by “covered entities.”\n- It prevents some companies from using contract law to skirt the bill’s regulations. \n\n### But the bill falls short on what is needed for robust privacy protections:\n\n- It has a broad preemption provision, which means it would override, and in some cases, roll back, existing state and federal privacy protections, including California’s [Consumer Privacy Protection Act](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa#:~:text=The%20California%20Consumer%20Privacy%20Act,how%20to%20implement%20the%20law).\n- It doesn’t provide enough protections for individuals who want to sue companies that violate their privacy rights.\n- It has loopholes that would treat some companies as “service providers,” giving them more leeway for collecting data.\n- It still broadly allows targeted advertising, which is a major driver of most commercial surveillance.\n\nYou can read more about the bill’s restrictions in EFF’s July 24, 2022 [blog post](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/americans-deserve-more-current-american-data-privacy-protection-act) about the bill.\n\n### What people/organizations in our space are saying about the ADPPA\n\n“Federal privacy laws should not roll back state privacy protections. The ADPPA, as currently written, would override a broad swath of existing state laws and prevent states from future action on those areas, a structure called \"preemption.\" We have expressed disappointment and called on Congress to do better.”\n–[Hayley Tsukayama, senior legislative activist at EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/federal-preemption-state-privacy-law-hurts-everyone)\n\n“It seems like a good faith effort, but the details will be key. Basically every privacy expert and advocacy group is reading it right now.” \n–[Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future](https://twitter.com/evan_greer/status/1532815840550191104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1532815840550191104%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.commondreams.org%2Fnews%2F2022%2F06%2F03%2Fadvocates-offer-cautious-praise-new-digital-privacy-bill-congress)\n\n“A lot’s being said about the American Data Privacy and Protection Act. But not nearly enough on how it dismantles current privacy laws, including over 50 years of work in California. There’s a reason Big Tech supports it. And it’s not because they care about our rights.”\n–[ACLU of Northern California](https://twitter.com/ACLU_NorCal/status/1552059006625034241)\n\n### What’s next for the ADPPA? \n\nNow that Congress is back from recess, the future of the ADPPA looks uncertain. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) [announced](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/9122) on Thursday, Sept. 4, 2022 that she is concerned about the bill’s preemption provisions, saying it  \"does not guarantee the same essential consumer protections as California’s existing privacy laws.\"\n\nWhether the bill has any hope of moving forward or is simply dead in the water depends on whether some sort of agreement will be reached that  – at the very least – softens the preemption provision.\n\nYou can read more about the political roadblocks ahead here in the International Association of Privacy Professionals' Sept. 6, 2022 [Privacy Advisor post](https://iapp.org/news/a/pelosi-rejects-proposed-american-data-privacy-and-protection-act-seeks-new-compromise/).\n\n### What you can do\nThe ADPPA still hasn’t reached the House floor so there is time to [contact your representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative#:~:text=If%20you%20know%20who%20your,the%20U.S.%20House%20switchboard%20operator) and tell them that the bill doesn’t go far enough in protecting your online privacy. We deserve legislation that encourages more robust online privacy protections, not laws that weaken the protections that already exist.\n\n</ContentSection>\n","news/digital-impact-podcast":"---\ntitle: Digital Impact Interview with Natalie\ndescription: Founder, Natalie Cadranel, discusses how \"Save\" protects citizen eye-witnesses from online threats with Chris Delatorre\ndate: 08/20/20\ncategory: News\nimage: digital-impact-interview-with-Natalie.png\n---\n\nimport { ArticleHeaderSection } from \"components/news/ArticleHeaderSection\";\nimport { ContentSection } from \"components/news/ContentSection\";\n\n<ArticleHeaderSection>\n![](digital-impact-interview-with-Natalie.png)\n\n{date}\n\n{category}\n\n## Digital Impact Interview with Natalie\n\nFounder, Natalie Cadranel, discusses how \"Save\" protects citizen eye-witnesses from online threats with Chris Delatorre\n\n</ArticleHeaderSection>\n<ContentSection>\n\nSave, a New Open-Source App, Empowers Citizen Reporters\n\n**Hear Natalie Cadranel, Founder and Director of OpenArchive, in conversation with Chris Delatorre from Stanford's Digital Impact Hub about the why, what, where, who, and how of \"Save\".**\n\n[Listen or read the full transcript on the Digital Impact site](https://digitalimpact.io/save-a-new-open-source-app-empowers-citizen-journalists).\n\n</ContentSection>\n","news/ffdw-grant":"---\ntitle: FFDW and OpenArchive Collaborate to Deploy Decentralized Archive for Human Rights Data\ndescription: OpenArchive receives Grant from FFDW to Help Secure, Share, and Store Critical Human Rights DataInformation on the Decentralized Web\ndate: 11/18/21\ncategory: News\nimage: FFDW-and-OpenArchive-Collaborate-to-Deploy-Decentralized-Archive-for-Human-Rights-Data.png\n---\n\nimport { ArticleHeaderSection } from \"components/news/ArticleHeaderSection\";\nimport { ContentSection } from \"components/news/ContentSection\";\n\n<ArticleHeaderSection>\n![](FFDW-and-OpenArchive-Collaborate-to-Deploy-Decentralized-Archive-for-Human-Rights-Data.png)\n\n{date}\n\n{category}\n\n## FFDW and OpenArchive Collaborate to Deploy Decentralized Archive for Human Rights Data\n\nOpenArchive receives Grant from FFDW to Help Secure, Share, and Store Critical Human Rights DataInformation on the Decentralized Web\n\n</ArticleHeaderSection>\n<ContentSection>\n[](ffdw-oa.png)\n\nOpenArchive is thrilled to announce our collaboration with Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW) to advance our mission to empower people to ethically collect, verify, and securely preserve their mobile media for the long term.\n\n[](blue-hands.png)\n\nThrough this collaboration, we are receiving a grant from FFDW to expand our **global partnerships with human rights defenders** and join the growing movement to create and utilize a **more ethical, decentralized internet.**\n\nOpenArchive will now be able to support those who collect evidentiary media by expanding the capacity of our [**_Save_**](/save) (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app to include decentralized backends.

However, many of these recordings are currently stored on vulnerable platforms that do not provide sufficient privacy protections or preservation of this vital media. When data is in the hands of a single company, it is susceptible to censorship, manipulation, or system-wide failure – putting the records of human history at risk. Decentralized technology offers a better alternative: it allows at-risk communities to own and control records to ensure transparency, accountability, and durability.\n\n> Every day, witnesses and citizen reporters bravely capture breaking world events–and all too often human rights violations–on their phones. At OpenArchive, we work to enable them to securely share, verify, and preserve this crucial media to ultimately bring accountability and justice.\n>\n> We’re thrilled to work with FFDW to build the web we want by implementing and deploying decentralized technology to empower witnesses to protect and preserve truth to power.\n>\n> **Natalie Cadranel**\n> Founder and Executive Director of OpenArchive\n\nSave is a secure archiving app that helps people share, archive, verify, and and encrypt their mobile media. They can do so by securely uploading it, keeping it safe and organized for the long-term, and capturing crucial metadata to further authenticate it. With support from FFDW, we are enhancing our existing archival tools to support decentralized storage solutions through Save. This work will ensure that everyone will have long-term access to secure and resilient decentralized storage to protect and preserve humanity’s most important information.\n\nAdditionally, as part of the grant, we will embark on a campaign to educate people and organizations around the world about the benefits of adopting decentralized storage protocols by equipping them with tools and educational resources.

Despite the egalitarian accolades heaped upon early content platforms startups, access to this new world of media has become unbalanced and asymmetrical.\n\n_Contra Media Ecosystems of Control_\n\nSocial media and other user-generated content platforms - sometimes referred to as “web 2.0” - promised to empower individuals from around the world by providing new communication channels to bypass traditional media gatekeepers. The ability for internet users to instantly upload content gave rise to an unprecedented look into political rallies, natural disasters, and military conflicts, but also daily life unfolding around the globe. People flocked to such platforms, so much so that, today, hundreds of hours of video content is added to social media platforms like YouTube each minute, while streaming services like Facebook Live have racked up over 2 billion viewers.\n\nDespite the egalitarian accolades heaped upon early content platforms startups, access to this new world of media has become unbalanced and asymmetrical. Over the past decade, this power has become centralized and entrenched. Motivated by profit maximization and an ever-expanding quest for new markets, these corporate giants have made Faustian deals with governments around the world to keep their services streaming into some of the world’s most repressive regimes. As such, these great content repositories of the modern area have become tools of control rather than the once-heralded \"platforms of the people\". Digital artifacts uploaded to the major social platforms are regulated by both a country’s laws and companies’ own internal content guidelines; and while the amount of mobile media traversing these global platforms is stunning, little attention is paid to their respect for human rights or longevity of access to uploaded content.\n\n_Delicate Memories_\n\nDespite their popularity, the world can not count on global technology companies to [have their users' backs](https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2017). Activists and technologists must forge their own paths by building new technologies and leveraging grassroots communities. OpenArchive was born out of the need for a mobile tool that offers secure, long-term storage of photos, video, and audio captured on mobile devices. Our tool seeks to solve the issues related to keeping people and their media safe, sustaining legacy access to, and providing verifiable authenticity of content. In high-risk situations, this need becomes even more profound. Human rights defenders, citizen journalists, and front-line activists are being targeted on social media and do not have safe, alternative ways to manage and store their sensitive mobile media. In some cases, being digitally compromised can impact an individual’s freedom and well-being.\n\n_Whose Media? Our Media!_\n\nBefore users learn the hard way that they cannot trust YouTube, Facebook, iCloud, Google Photos and other corporate platforms with valued and sensitive digital media, we provide an alternative secure archiving solution at scale. To further this goal, OpenArchive works with [Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info), who specialize in creating secure, open source technologies. Through this partnership, along with security usability experts, we will double our efforts to provide our global community with an easy-to-use, secure archiving application that empowers users to circumvent threats to freedom of expression such as device confiscation, network blocking, internet shutdowns, and more. OpenArchive is working towards secure, ethical, and usable solutions for you and your communities.\n\n**We’re listening!**\n\n- In order to make the strongest product for our users, we want to hear from you.

From social networks to video hosting\nplatforms, many of the go-to media hosting platforms are monetized by invasive adtech, driven by surveillance features, and subjected to arbitrary content takedowns. We created **_Save_** to authenticate and safeguard media for long-term preservation and protect the identity of those\nsharing their documentation. While researching and creating the tool with the communities it serves, we paid special attention to threats that we increasingly encounter when posting citizen journalism online, such as internet shutdowns, targeting journalists online, device confiscations,\ncensorship, limited bandwidth, and data loss.\n\nWhile embarking on OpenArchive’s journey to launch our new flagship tool **_Save_**, we were deliberately careful to incorporate feedback from our extensive ethnographic research and incorporate emergent digital archiving practices. With a mission to provide an alternative hosting\nframework to commercially available products, **_Save_** puts control of the lifecycle of mobile\nmedia back in the hands of those who created the media: citizen journalists, human rights defenders, and others risking their freedom to share their stories. With native functionalities that include adding nuanced metadata for verification and Creative Commons licensing, **_Save_**\nwas built to streamline a user experience that is intuitive for both individuals and organizations.\n\nWe couldn’t be where we are today without a wonderful community of supporters, many of whom have volunteered their time to help us design **_Save_** with our end-users’ safety, security and diverse circumstances in mind. We are also grateful to generous support from the Open Technology Fund and Knight Foundation who have helped OpenArchive continue to develop tools, integrate best practices, and improve usability over the past years.\n\nIn the coming year, the OpenArchive team will continue to engage with our community, offer trainings, improve documentation, share our expertise, and advocate for open archiving frameworks that allow people to store and manage their content outside the walled gardens of proprietary Silicon Valley companies.\n\nLast month, OpenArchive’s founder Natalie joined panels and hosted a workshop\nto share **_Save_** with the Human Rights community at [RightsCon](https://rightscon.org) in Tunis. We want to take every opportunity we have to engage with the communities we serve so we can continually improve the functionality and usability they require and ensure that people can\nmanage their digital media outside of the surveillance capitalism-driven media management systems currently on the market.

In this post, we'll share strategies the resistance is using to document and fight back against military violence, as well as keep the movement alive.\n\n### But first, a history lesson\n\nThe February 2021 coup d'état returned Myanmar to military rule under the so-called [Tatmadaw](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/28/world/asia/myanmar-army-protests.html), the armed forces of Myanmar. But the push and pull of military power and democratic government structure goes back more than 70 years.\n\n<iframe\n  src=\"https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1yVXtDdFqwZYq0vW8cGIXLznk4tKZ7Vcd4Oi9HuKtNzc&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650\"\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"650\"\n  allowFullScreen\n  frameBorder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n\n### Sustaining a movement\n\nMyanmar’s post-coup resilience is built on decades of struggle against oppressors: from [British imperialism](https://www.britannica.com/place/Myanmar/The-initial-impact-of-colonialism) to the current military power. While the country’s liberalization over the past decade systematically [excluded](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-election-rohingya/rohingya-politicians-excluded-from-myanmar-election-idUSKBN25L02T) ethnic and religious minority groups, protests and resistance efforts since the coup are much more inclusive.\n\nGlobal Voices [reported](https://globalvoices.org/2021/03/13/in-the-streets-and-online-myanmars-citizens-unite-in-creative-opposition-to-the-military-junta/) in February 2021 that the General Strike Committee of All Nationalities (GSCN) united 27 of Myanmar's ethnic nationalities, displaying a show of unity against a common enemy.\n\nDuwa Lashi La, a lawyer, and politician who serves as the acting president of the National Unity Government (Myanmar’s government in exile composed of lawmakers and those elected in the 2020 elections) told [The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2022/07/duwa-lashi-la-on-the-state-of-myanmars-resistance/) in July that integrating Ethnic Resistance Organizations (EROs) has helped the pro-democracy resistance maintain territories in the Chin State, Sagaing, and Magwe regions.\n\n“Despite the challenges, I have never seen a more promising time for our people to find common ground and establish a genuine federal union together,” Duwa Lashi La, who himself is of Kachin descent, told The Diplomat.\n\nAn independent researcher who studies digital activism in Myanmar, referred to here by the pseudonym Joseph, says what also sets this latest movement apart from past resistance efforts is that it’s being led by a much younger generation, armed with smartphones and a new sense of digital literacy.\n\nThis new generation of resistance fighters already experienced life under a liberal democracy, meanwhile their older counterparts aren’t ready to go back to the way things were, he says. “They’ve already enjoyed a taste of freedom.”\n\n### Staying safe while on the ground\n\nMa Sabai – who asked to be referred to by this pseudonym – was in Yangon when the Spring Revolution erupted in early 2021. Her home was home just blocks away from daily protests and actions.\n\nBefore the coup, Ma Sabai was already an active part of pro-democracy circles, educating her community on democratization, federalism and Myanmar’s constitutional process.\n\nWhen the military junta took over in Feb. 2021, she along with fellow resistance fighters took to the streets and documented both the protests and military violence on civilians. Young people in particular were targeted in mass arrests, torture and killings, according to [Radio Free Asia](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/youths-05072021164621.html).\n\nAt sundown, Ma Sabai would bang pots and pans with her neighbors to protest the military power.\n\n“[The military] did not like that. They tried to hit us and shoot us with tear gas and they tried to arrest people,” she says.\n\nWhen security forces attempted to “disperse” the crowds, Ma Sabai said she would run to shelter. Some civilians who lived close to the action, including her brother, allowed protesters to take refuge in their homes.\n\nOnce she and fellow resistance fighters found a safe place, they would hide all tools and pamphlets related to the revolution and quickly change their clothes so they couldn’t be recognized or tracked.\n\n### Staying anonymous while supporting a cause\n\nIn Myanmar, anyone who so much as “likes” pro-democracy and resistance content on social media can face up to [10 years in prison](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-military-threatens-jail-online-likes-opponents-2022-09-20/).\n\nMa Sabai says she keeps multiple Facebook profiles with different names to keep her identity safe. She also never posts or interacts with resistance content on her personal social media accounts.\n\nWhen leaving the house, Ma Sabi says she deletes all social media apps and VPNs from her devices.\n\nNow, almost two years since protests erupted in Myanmar, the military is refocusing efforts toward cracking down on other forms of dissent like donating to revolutionary causes.\n\nA lawyer, who requested to remain anonymous as they advise on-the-ground activists in Myanmar on how to stay safe while documenting social unrest and human rights abuses, shared with us some strategies people use to mitigate risks.\n\nAverage civilians who want to donate to or support organizations like the People’s Defense Force (PDF) – the revolutionary group fighting against the military junta – often have to take extra steps to protect themselves, according to the lawyer.\n\nOne way is to label donations online with something innocuous. People donating from outside the country have to go through multiple layers of bank accounts to make it harder for the ruling regime to track transactions.\n\n### Navigating digital security under state surveillance\n\nWith the threat of military surveillance omnipresent, it becomes crucial to ensure those capturing military violence and coordinating, participating in, and documenting pro-democracy movements know how to keep themselves digitally secure.\n\nIt’s vital to only share sensitive organizing information on end-to-end messaging platforms like Signal and Telegram. “We also started giving ourselves aliases and different names, so that they will not be able to track us,” the lawyer says.\n\nFor communication via email, the lawyer encouraged others to start using ProtonMail, which also provides security through end-to-end encryption.\n\nGetting people to adopt more secure tools and messaging platforms hasn’t been easy, the lawyer says. For many people in Myanmar, Facebook is esentially the internet, and often acts as the primary organizing tool for civil disobedience campaigns, labor strikes, and other actions.\n\nAfter recognizing the power of smartphones in resistance efforts, the junta began implementing random checkpoints and searches on civilians’ phones.\n\nBoth the lawyer and Ma Sabai say activists, eyewitnesses, and documentarians often keep multiple phones; one for personal use, and one for documenting protests and military violence.\n\n“If they find any content related to the revolution, you can be arrested and jailed,” the lawyer says.\n\nWhen Ma Sabai was documenting protests in 2021, she uploaded crucial evidence of military violence onto a cloud service before deleting it on her phone. Sometimes she would store files in a folder labeled with an inconspicuous name before military authorities had the chance to search her device.\n\nFor the lawyer – who is currently based in the U.S. – encouraging digital security practices is a matter of life and death.\n\n“I have to really make sure that my family is safe back home because if you're outside of the country, they come after your family,” he says.\n\n### Controlling the narrative\n\nThe the anti-coup resistance is fought both on the ground and [online](https://globalvoices.org/2021/03/13/in-the-streets-and-online-myanmars-citizens-unite-in-creative-opposition-to-the-military-junta/), with civilians controlling the narrative through hashtags like #WhatshappeninginMyanmar and publicly shaming military supporters online.\n\nWhile good for the revolution, social media is also used as a tool by the military to fight back against the resistance, Joseph says.\n\nWhen military leaders seized power, internet providers in Myanmar were ordered to ban Facebook (Meta)-owned services in the country, including Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. The demand for virtual private networks (VPNs) surged in the country, but the lawyer says the junta is currently seeking a ban on [VPNs](https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-juntas-new-cyber-law-to-jail-anyone-using-vpn.html).\n\nMilitary authorities also use social media to disseminate [junta propaganda](https://globalvoices.org/2022/07/07/myanmars-military-propaganda-about-schools-rampant-on-social-media/).\n\nRadio Free Asia reported in March that military authorities often use Telegram to collect intelligence on pro-democracy celebrities, anti-junta activists, and journalists. Activists [told RFA](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/social-media-03032022175020.html) that the military uses this information to crack down on anti-junta actions across the country.\n\nIn August, Tatmadaw spokesman Major-General Zaw Min Tun [announced](https://www.irrawaddy.com/specials/junta-watch/junta-watch-plans-for-facebook-substitute-unveiled-military-admits-coup-and-more.html) that the regime plans to replace Facebook with its own homegrown social media platform.\n\n“It’s kind of scary,” Joseph says. “If they start doing that and contain [social media communications] there is no way to escape.”\n\n### Keep up with #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar\n\nThe situation in Myanmar is constantly changing and evolving.

This provides security-minded individuals and teams with a responsible, innovative “off the shelf” front-end solution for ethically collecting and curating their media from around the world. Whether hosted on individual servers or integrated with an organization's existing technical infrastructure, **_Save_** is engineered to create robust protection of and redundancy for mobile-captured media content.\n\nUnlike most of today's major media platforms, **_Save_** values human rights over corporate profits. By streamlining media workflows to facilitate rapid response and reporting, it shifts power into the hands of those on the front lines. This means that the information sent through it cannot be censored, blocked or arbitrarily deleted.\n\nOur **_Save_** app, which is open source and available for free through the iOS App Store and Google Play, fills the urgent need for an alternative to mainstream technologies, one that enables free and reliable sharing of evidence of human rights abuses and breaking news in ways that are easily accessed and managed.\n\nThe **_Save_** app fills a long-standing need to provide secure, fully encrypted and self-hosted file transfer for our staff all over the world,\" says Nicole Martin, Senior Manager of Archives and Digital Systems at Human Rights Watch. \"OpenArchive carefully listened to our needs, built an intuitive app, and tailored its features to make human rights data safer, and my job a whole lot easier.\n\nWith support from public interest advocates, a team of open source developers, human rights archivists and ethnographers, digital security experts, journalists, and international civil society members incorporated extensive community input while creating **_Save_**.\n\n</ContentSection>\n","partner":"import { HeaderSection } from \"components/partner/HeaderSection\";\nimport { OpportunitySection } from \"components/partner/OpportunitySection\";\nimport { OpportunityItem } from \"components/partner/OpportunityItem\";\n\n<HeaderSection>\n    # Partner With Us\n\n</HeaderSection>\n<OpportunitySection>\n  <OpportunityItem>\n    ![](PartnerWithUs/partner-1.png)\n\n    ##### NGO Partnerships\n\n    Are you working at a human rights-NGO that needs a more streamlined and secure media intake and archiving process?
